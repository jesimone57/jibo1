## Usage

**husl.toHex(hue, saturation, lightness)**

*hue* is a number between 0 and 360, *saturation* and *lightness* are 
numbers between 0 and 100. This function returns the resulting color as 
a hex string.

**husl.toRGB(hue, saturation, lightness)**

Like above, but returns an array of 3 numbers between 0 and 1, for the 
r, g, and b channel.

**husl.fromHex(hex)**

Takes a hex string and returns the HUSL color as array that contains 
the hue (0-360), saturation(0-100) and lightness(0-100) channel.
_Note_: The result can have rounding errors. For example saturation can 
be 100.00000000000007

**husl.fromRGB(red, green, blue)**

Like above, but *red*, *green* and *blue* are passed as numbers between 
0 and 1.

Use **husl.p.toHex**, **husl.p.toRGB**, **husl.p.fromHex** and 
**husl.p.fromRGB** for the pastel variant (HUSLp). Note that HUSLp does 
not contain all the colors of RGB, so converting arbitrary RGB to it may 
generate invalid HUSLp colors.
